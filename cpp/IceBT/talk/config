# The server creates one single object adapter with the name "Talk".
# The following line sets the endpoint for this object adapter.
#
# When no -a <addr> option is specified in the endpoints, the default
# value from the Ice.Default.Host property is used. If this property
# isn't set, the endpoint will listen on the system's default
# Bluetooth adapter.
#
# The UUID is a unique identifier associated with this talk service.
# Other talk apps must also know this identifier.
#
# The value for the --name option will appear in the Bluetooth SDP
# registry but is only for informational purposes.
