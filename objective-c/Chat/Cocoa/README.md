This demo is a Cocoa client for the
[ZeroC Chat Demo](https://zeroc.com/chat/index.html). This demo
connects to a single chat room, allowing you to chat with other chat
room participants.

By default, the demo connects to the chat server hosted on demo.zeroc.com through a WebSocket reverse proxy hosted on zeroc.com.

You may use any user name and password when connecting.

If you would like to run your own server, or are otherwise interested
in the Chat Demo, the complete source is available
