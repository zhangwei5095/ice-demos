This demo is an iPhone client for the
[Java library demo](../../../../java/Database/library). This
application provides a graphical interface to the library server. It
permits you to:

- Create and delete books
- Query for books by isbn, author or title
- Rent and return books

ZeroC hosts a server for this demo on demo2.zeroc.com. The iPhone
client connects to this host by default. The deployment on
demo2.zeroc.com accepts both secure and non-secure connections using
Glacier2 or direct connections to the library session manager.
