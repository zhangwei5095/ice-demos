A simple callback demo that illustrates how a client can pass a proxy
to a server, invoke an operation in the server, and the server call
back into an object provided by the client as part of that invocation.

To run the demo, first start the server:

$ java -jar build/libs/server.jar

In a separate window, start the client:

$ java -jar build/libs/client.jar
