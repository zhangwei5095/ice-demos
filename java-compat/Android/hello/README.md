This directory contains an Android Studio project for the hello client.

The hello client is the Android equivalent of our command-line demo
of the same name. In order to use this client, you must run a hello
server and enter the server's address in the client's "Hostname"
field. You can use a server from your Ice installation.

Refer to the [parent directory](../README.md) for build instructions.
