# Ice Demos

The ice-demos repository provides sample programs for Ice, Ice-E, and Ice Touch.

## Layout

The sample programs are grouped by programming language:

* [C++](./cpp)
* [C#](./csharp)
* [Java](./java)
* [Java-Compat](./java-compat)
* [JavaScript](./js)
* [Objective-C](./objective-c)
* [PHP](./php)
* [Python](./python)
* [Ruby](./ruby)

For example, the [cpp](./cpp) folder contains all the sample programs written
in C++.

The [certs](./certs) folder contains X.509 certificates shared by some of these
sample programs.

## Platform Support

The sample programs are not all available on all platforms. For example, the
[C#](./csharp) sample programs are currently only for Windows and were not
tested on any other platform.

## Building and Running the Sample Programs

The README file in each language subdirectory provides instructions for
building and running the sample programs.
