This demo illustrates the use of Asynchronous Message Invocation (AMI)
and Asynchronous Message Dispatch (AMD).

To run the demo, first start the server:

$ server

In a second window, start the client:

$ client 

The demo invocation can either have a short response time or require a
significant amount of time to complete. For the long running request
the client uses AMI and the server uses AMD plus a worker thread to 
process the request. While a long request is processing, short 
requests are still able to be processed and more long requests can be
queued for processing by the worker thread.
